/*Throughout the rest of this project, we will use the fetch() browser API to make our requests.
Since fetch() is a browser API, older browsers may not support it.
To increase the accessibilty of Ravenous to a wider audience of users,
weâ€™ll need to add a fetch() polyfill to support older browsers.
Within the Ravenous directory in your terminal, run npm install whatwg-fetch --save
to install the whatwg-fetch polyfill and add it to your package.json file.*/
